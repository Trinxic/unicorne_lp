### Bill of Materials
#### Mounting
* 10 x m2x4mm countersunk screws - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32968097507.html)
* 10 x m2x5mm button head screws - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32967225441.html)
* 10 x m2x8mm female-female standoffs - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001271908929.html) (for standard 1.6mm fr4 plates; if you plan on using thicker plates, such as 3mm acrylic ones, you will need to subtract the difference in thickness from the standoff, eg: 3mm plates would require 6.5mm standoffs)
#### Tenting
* 8 x m5 socket head cap screws of various lengths according to your own preference, for the tenting version - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001785690381.html)
* 8 x m5 locknuts, for the tenting version - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32988995881.html)
* 8 x 4.7mm inner diameter rubber caps, for the tenting version - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002270601725.html)
* 8 x 10x2mm silicone feet - [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001297404341.html) variant K1002

### Revisions: this case was specifically redisigned for the [BoardSource Unicorn_LP](https://www.boardsource.xyz/products/unicorne-LP)
* Note: the plate is completely unchanged from the one found on [Void's Printables page](https://www.printables.com/model/347524-corne-keyboard-case-5-and-6-columns)
* lowered the walls of the case to adhere with the height of the Kailh low-profile switches/keys
* increased the hight of the walls around the OLED displays
* resized the holes for the connecting cables --> BoardSource's Unicorne (regular & low-profile) uses USB-C ports instead of TRRS
